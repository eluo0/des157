  <h1>Storyboards</h1>
  <p>Settings</p>
  <p>People who involves in this project are ones who have countered depressions, anxiety, or mood disorder. I will be using virtual environment for this project because I'm creating an argumented reality environment for my users. For the task part, I will need to create different filters, such as anxiety filter, sad filter, and mood detection filter. For the sad filter, there will be a text message included in the filter for the purpose of encouragement. </p>
  <p>Sequence</p>
  <p>I believe people who ever have feelings of anxiety and sadness (almost everyone has experience in that) will want to use it. Steps: I will use mainly two libaries. One of them is the mood detection library. Another one is the argmented reality library. There will be a lot of coding involved as well as website layout design.</p>
