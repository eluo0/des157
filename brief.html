  <h1>Creative Brief</h1>
  <h2>Topic Summary</h2>
    <p>Many people believe technology has negative effects on mental health and communicating through technology can result in lacking in human affection and emotional interaction. People also believe technology makes us depressed, anxious, and addicted in many ways. For this project, I want to challenge this idea and prove that technology can actually helps human emotional exchange through the interaction from computer and bring happiness to their lives. By using the technology of argumented reality (AR), I create many different AR filters, including anxiety filter, sad filter, and mood detection filter, for mental health treatments. </p>

<h2>Target Audience Description</h2>
<p>My target audience are people who face mood disorders and have ever experienced saddness or anxiety. They can be people who don't have mental disorders and are just experiencing saddness or anxiety. My audience can also be people who actually have mental disorders, such as depression. My project cannnot actually make them recover from mental disorder but it can help bring happiness to my audience as a mood therapy as well as being entertaining.</p>

<h2>The Goals Of The Project (and how it will work)</h2>
<p>For the anxiety filter, I want to create a calming argumented environment by filter for users to relax and de-stress. Sad filtr is for users who have faced challenges in life and felt sad about their current situation. I will create some text message filter to encourage my users to not give up on it and to keep fighting for their goals in life. In addition to that, the mood detection filter uses the technology of facial recognition to detect your current mood and generate different filter based on your mood.</p>

<h2>Goals For The Overall Look And Feel</h2>
<p>For the overall look, I want to use computer-generated art as the decoration of my website and I will make my webcam and filters look similar to the snapchat app interface. I will use calming and soft colors in my website. Because I'm targetting mental health problems, I want my visual look more calming and soft so that it wouldn't bring anxiousness or stress to users while they viewing the website. My end result will look like a one-page scroll website, has computer-generated art, and has circle-shaped filter icons that are similart to the app of Snapchat.  </p>
