  <h1>Background research</h1>
  <p>A lot of people believe communicating through technology will result in lacking in human affection and emotional interaction. I decided to challenge this idea and to create a web-based technology that helps human emotional exchange through the interaction from computer. Thus, I researched the information about human emotion and how computer can help creating affection between human users. In the article “What Are Basic Emotions?”, Burton identified our seven primary emotions based on first-century Chinese encyclopedia that are joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, disliking, and liking. In the 20th century, there was another philosopher who identified our six basic emotions that are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. He also mentioned that basic emotions evolves based on the ecological challenges faced by our ancestors. I believe this is fairly interesting because I didn’t know that even human emotions can change over time based upon the what survival challenges our ancestors faced. In addition to that, I will use these identified emotions as a research foundation to create the interaction and affection between human and computer. I also researched a few project that is related to human computer interaction. I found this Virtual Reality project at MIT Media Lab, named Emotional Beasts which is an excellent example of creating affection between human and technology. In the project description, the creator explains that this project is an experiment with the manipulation of a user’s self-expression in VR space and as well as the perception of others in it. He also says that his project aims at providing the valuable experience for users to evoke a desired emotional reaction. In this project, it is really interesting to see how technology allows us to become more expressive in virtual world. I believe this project challenged our traditional believes of how technology is used in a non-emotional way. Moreover, I found out this app called Code Blue which is designed to provide teenagers struggling from depression with support in need. I found this app is really interesting and can be implemented to my website because it’s a wonderful project. The reason for that is because users can use this app to share their currently locations with their support group so that they can get help when they are in need. I believe this mental health app is very different from other traditional mental health apps because this app is actually giving health by taking actions rather than just passive giving instruction to users to cope with their emotions. This project is also related to human computer interaction which is really great to be an example of my final project.
