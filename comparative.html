  <h2 class="category">SuperBetter - Category: App</h2>
  <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>The app targets negative thoughts and encourages healthy habits that leads to better mental health. The app is created by Jane McGonigal, a video game designer.</p>
<p>Her mission for creating this app is: “to save the world by putting the principles of video game to good use.” Also, she explains in her TedTalk that how people feel capable and dedicated when playing video games and her goal is to transfer those feelings into tackling real world problems.</p>
<h3>INTERFACE DESIGN</h3>
<p>I think the overall color theme used in the interface design is quite colorful. The rainbow colors often showed in its design (like its logo).</p>
<p>For the introduction part, users can swipe left or right to switch the page. By doing that, it’s convenient for users to look up the app introduction and information.</p>
<p>I think the swipe part of the interface design is pretty well done because it’s useful to use this way to display information so that it looks more organized and is easy to understand the content.</p>

<p>For the Choose Your Challenge part, there’s a scroll bar appeared at the bottom of the screen when you click on the selection bar. I think it’s a nicer design than the design that just makes the scroll bar appear under the selection bar. This way of design (scroll bar appear at the bottom) is easy for users to click on and is more organized.</p>

<p>This image shows the tabs of each page. The tab names include activity, HQ, to do, profile, and more. I like how clean and organized the overall layout is. The color that is mainly used on the main page is blue. I believe the use of color blue makes the whole design look more calming and clean.</p>

<p>This page will show up once users completed a task. The rainbow color theme showed up again on the screen. It gives a positive and optimistic image to the app.</p>

<h3>OVERALL EXPERIENCE</h3>
<p>I really like the whole concept of this app. I also like the design of it, like the use of colors and layout. It looks clean and organized. However, users have to keep on track on the completion of their assigned task every day. I wonder if the users will be determined to keep updating the information in this app. I’m concerned that users may feel bored and no longer use this app after a few days because I feel it’s hard for this app to keep the users.</p>
<h2 class="category">MindShift - Category: App</h2>
<h3>ABOUT</h3>
<P>MindShift is an app designed to help teens and young adults cope with anxiety. It aims to help you change how you think about anxiety. Rather than trying to avoid anxiety, you can make an important shift and face it. This app helps you learn how to relax, develop more helpful ways of thinking, and identify active steps that will help you take charge of your anxiety. The strategies that this app included are Making Sleep Count, Riding Out Intense Emotions, Test Anxiety, Perfectionism, Social Anxiety, Performance Anxiety, Worry, Panic, Conflict.</P>
<h3>INTERFACE DESIGN</h3>
<p>Compared to SuperBetter, the overall interface design is more plain and simple. Even though MindShift has the same introduction screen that directs users to swipe right or left to view the information, I feel the design of SuperBetter is way better than MindShift. There’s no a lot of colors used in this app. The main color used in this app is blue which is similar to SuperBetter, but no rainbow colors. I would say the user interface design of MindShift is lacking in style and design because it just looks too plain. </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There’re 9 categories included in this app.They are: Anxiety 101, My Situation, Check Yourself, Thinking Right, Chill Out Tools, Active Steps, Inspiration, Settings, Help. I feel the organization of this app is quite simple. The good thing about this app is that it’s easy to navigate since the organization of this app is simple. However, the icons of each category looks really plain. I feel this app company really needs to hire a better interface designer to work on their user interface design. If the design of this app is more colorful and has more interesting graphic images, it would attract more users, especially their target audience which are teens and young adults.</p>

<p>When I click on Anxiety 101, this screen popped up and it asked me to add a situation. After choosing one of the situations (like Riding Out intense Emotions), there’s explanation showed and tells users how to code their emotion. I feel this is a good strategy in this app. I also feel this app is more like a professional psychological coping anxiety app. I would guess that each coding anxiety strategy included in this app is based on the suggestion of the real-world psychologists or psychiatrists. I think that’s a good thing about this app. Yet, the design is too plain.</p>

<h3>OVERALL EXPERIENCE</h3>
<P>For my overall experience of this app, I would say the content is really good because I think they are based on the advice from real-world psychologists or psychiatrists. However, the interface design is lacking in color and graphic design. The overall organization of this app is simple and easy to navigate all the information. I believe overall MindShift is a good app that offers real advice from people in the mental health profession. However, they need to work on their graphic design more as a means to make it look more interesting and to keep the users.</P>
